#### Rationale

As modern astrophysical surveys deliver an unprecedented amount of data, from the imaging of hundreds of millions of distant galaxies to the mapping of cosmic radiation fields at ultra-high resolution, conventional data analysis methods are reaching their limits in both computational complexity and optimality. Deep Learning has rapidly been adopted by the astronomical community as a promising way of exploiting these forthcoming big-data datasets and of extracting the physical principles that underlie these complex observations. This has led to an unprecedented exponential growth of publications with in the last year alone about 500 astrophysics papers mentioning deep learning or neural networks in their abstract. Yet, many of these works remain at an exploratory level and have not been translated into real scientific breakthroughs.

**The goal of this workshop is to bring together Machine Learning researchers and domain experts in the field of Astrophysics to discuss the key open issues which hamper the use of Deep Learning for scientific discovery.**

An important aspect to the success of Machine Learning in Astrophysics is to create a two-way interdisciplinary dialog in which concrete data-analysis challenges can spur the development of dedicated Machine Learning tools. This workshop is designed to facilitate this dialog and will include a mix of interdisciplinary invited talks and panel discussions, providing an *opportunity for ICML audiences to connect their research interests to concrete and outstanding scientific challenges*.

We welcome in particular contributions that target, *or report on*, the following non-exhaustive list of open problems:
- Efficient high-dimensional Likelihood-based and Simulation-Based Inference
- Robustness to covariate shifts and model misspecification
- Anomaly and outlier detection, search for rare signals with ML
- Methods for accurate uncertainty quantification
- Methods for improved interpretability of models
- (Astro)-physics informed models, models which preserve symmetries and equivariances
- Deep Learning for accelerating numerical simulations
- Benchmarking and deployment of ML models for large-scale data analysis

Contributions on these topics do not necessarily need to be Astrophysics-focused, works on relevant ML methodology, or similar considerations in other scientific fields, are welcome.

# Call for Abstracts

We invite all contributions in connection with the theme of the workshop as described [here](#rationale), from the fields of Astrophysics and Machine Learning, but also from other scientific fields facing similar challenges.

Original contributions and early research works are encouraged. Contributions presenting recently published or currently under review results are also welcome. The workshop will not have formal proceedings, but accepted submissions will be linked on the workshop webpage.

Submissions, in the form of extended abstracts, need to adhere to the [ICML 2022 format](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2022/StyleAuthorInstructions) ([LaTeX style files](https://media.icml.cc/Conferences/ICML2022/Styles/icml2022.zip)), be anonymized, and be no longer than 4 pages (excluding references). After double-blind review, a limited set of submissions will be selected for contributed talks, and a wider set of submissions will be selected for poster presentations.

Please submit your anonymized extended abstract through CMT at [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ML4Astro2022](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ML4Astro2022)  **before May 16th, 23:59 AOE**.
